   <main>For over 25 years Boomarang Diner locations have been serving up real food to the people of Oklahoma. Our roots are in the community that grows up around each of our Boomarang Diner locations and thanks to that community Boomarang Diner has grown to over 54 locations in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City Metroes, Ada, Enid and Lawton. The first Boomarang Diner was founded over 25 years ago as the East Side Diner in Muskogee, Oklahoma. From the beginning, Boomarang Diner has been dedicated to real food made by real people. As a proud, family-owned business we want our customers to feel at home and enjoy a classic, delicious meal at a place where everyone knows their name. We don’t make fast food, we make good food fast! You can’t beat a home-cooked meal, but we come close. We started the goal to make the best burger ever and to do so consistently every day and we keep that commitment to quality every day across all 54 of our locations. Come down to your local Boomarang Diner to experience the best burger, best breakfast, and best service in Oklahoma. Our food is so good, we know you’ll come back!
