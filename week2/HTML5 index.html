    <h3>About</h3>
     <p>The marvel movies are the best movie series in my opinion. I have groot and spider man on there because they are too of my favorite charaters.
       groot is my favorite because he is funny and i just think he is cool and just funny. I have spider man as my second overall favorite because he is
       funny as well but also has alot of action and over all i just think groot is a little better. If i would have put a runner up it would have been hulk 
       no real reason just a cool part of the movies.

    <h4>Span</h4>
     <span>I think The Marvel Avengers movie series is the most enjoyable series for all ages. I think the movies storyline is amazing from start to finsh with everything lining up
       and making sense. The was they put the movies together and made them all run along the comics aswell as a series is good and didnt change it up to much. Alot of people like comics
       so its good that they kept it as close to the comics as they could.
